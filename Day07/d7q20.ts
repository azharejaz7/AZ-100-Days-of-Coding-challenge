// Question 20: Think of something you could store in an array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

// Explain & TIP: Arrays are perfect for keeping a collection of similar items. Choose a theme you like and list several examples.

let countries :string[] = ["japan","indonesia","Canada","Brazil","kuwait"];
let mountains :string[] = ["Mount Everest","K2 Pkaistan"];
let languages :String[] = ["Urdu","Japness","Chiness","English"];
let cities :string[] = ["Karachi","islamabad","New York",];

console.log(`${countries}`);
console.log(`${mountains}`);
console.log(`${languages}`);
console.log(`${cities}`);
